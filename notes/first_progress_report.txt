Decided to use librosa to:

- perform short time fourier transform 
- possibly use chromagram 
- possibly use rhythm feature extraction

Upcoming tests:

- Use both stft and chroma/rhythm to classify slices
- Use K means or other unsupervised clustering to analyze data

Biggest upcoming challenges:

- matching targets with stft time slices
-
